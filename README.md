Super-resolution project I worked on for my Computer Vision class.

The idea behind this project was to create a small network that is able to upscale images, with 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x and 32x.
Another task was to use only one image for training and one image for validation.

To evaluate the model, 10 test images were used.
